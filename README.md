## Future Work

We all love working on this project and we all want to continue to work on it during this summer.
We will try to deploy the app to a server, save the predictions to make them more accurate with maybe another neural network.
Also we will try to connect the prediction with an online wallet to earn money, so the app will act like a trading bot.
